# A bloc Timer Emoji

A slightly different version than the one presented at https://bloclibrary.dev/#/fluttertimertutorial.

In this repository, I have followed the steps in the tutorial to learn how to create a project that follows the structure proposed by bloc library. I have allowed myself the license to modify the view so that it shows an emoji instead of the timer.
